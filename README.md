#  Recruitment Insights – SQL & Power BI Dashboard

##  Description
End-to-end recruitment analytics using **SQL** for data manipulation and **Power BI** for interactive visualization.  
This project explores hiring trends, applicant funnels, and workforce demographics to inform data-driven talent strategies.

---

##  Project Overview
This analysis aims to uncover key recruitment patterns—from application to hire—using SQL queries and Power BI dashboarding.  
It examines metrics such as applicant volume, hiring conversion rates, and demographic distributions to guide efficient recruitment decision-making.

##  Tools & Skills Used
- **SQL** – data extraction, cleaning, aggregation, funnel metrics  
- **Power BI** – data modeling, interactive visualizations, dashboards  
- **Recruitment Analytics Concepts** – funnel tracking, demographic analysis, hiring metrics

---

##  Key Steps

### 1. Data Preparation (SQL)
- Loaded raw recruitment datasets into a SQL platform (e.g., PostgreSQL or MS SQL Server).  
- Cleaned and standardized data formats (dates, missing values).  
- Wrote queries to compute recruitment funnel metrics:  
  - Total applicants  
  - Candidate shortlists  
  - Interviews conducted  
  - Offers made  
  - Hires finalized

### 2. Metric Computation & Aggregation
- Calculated conversion rates at each stage of the funnel.
- Analyzed time-to-hire, candidate sourcing channels, and department-level performance.
- Generated summary tables for demographic insights (e.g., gender, department, geographic distribution).

### 3. Power BI Visualization
In Power BI, created an interactive dashboard featuring:
- **Funnel Chart** – visualize drop-offs between recruitment stages.
- **Hiring Metrics Cards** – display KPIs like total applicants, hire rate, average time-to-hire.
- **Demographic Breakdown** – interactive visuals for gender, department, location.
- **Trend Analysis** – line or bar charts showing hiring volume and conversion trends over time.
- **Slicer Filters** – enable dynamic filtering by time period, department, or candidate source.

---

##  Key Insights
- **Funnel drop-off**: Largest candidate losses occur between initial application and shortlist stages.  
- **Departmental variation**: Some departments demonstrate higher shortlist-to-interview conversion rates.  
- **Time-to-hire**: Average hiring duration shows periodic spikes—highlighting process inefficiencies.  
- **Demographics**: Certain locations or candidate groups are underrepresented, suggesting room for inclusivity improvements.

---

##  Recommendations
- **Streamline initial screening** to reduce candidate drop-off—automate resume pre-screening or offer clearer qualification criteria.  
- **Focus hiring training** on departments with low conversion—equip hiring managers to conduct better interviews.  
- **Monitor and optimize hiring timelines**, especially during peaks, to reduce delays and improve candidate experience.  
- **Boost sourcing diversity** by expanding channels to reach underrepresented regions or candidate profiles.
